# WIFI-based-Remote-Control-Car
This project transforms a Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266) into a high-performance, mobile-responsive RC car controller. Unlike standard web-controlled projects that require constant page refreshes, this implementation uses JavaScript (AJAX/Fetch API) and CSS Grid to create a professional, low-latency D-Pad interface.
